# üî≠ **E-Commerce App**

<p>A small attempt to make an E-Commerce Application developed using FlutterFire (Flutter+Firebase). I have tried to collect all the basic features of any E -Commerce App into this application. It uses Flutter Framework for App Frontend and Backend, and Firebase as server maintaining Databases and Storage requirments of the app. It uses Firebase Authentication, Firebase Cloud Firestore, Firebase Storage. I developed this application just for learning purpose. I am a beginner in flutter so if you found any error solve it.</p>
